            <p>Hi! My name is Bruna Ara√∫jo, I am from Brazil. I love puppies! I am 22 years old,
                and I love studying and learn new things. I currently work in a billingual school, 
                thanks to the English I learnt on the mission and during my studies at BYU Pathway Worldwide. 
                I am a Software Development student at BYU Idaho.</p>
